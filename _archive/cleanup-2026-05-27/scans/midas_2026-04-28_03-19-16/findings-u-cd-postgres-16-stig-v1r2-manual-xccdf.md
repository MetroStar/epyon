Evidence:
- Static repository review completed on 2026-04-28.
- Control-specific implementation evidence was not demonstrably satisfied from repository artifacts alone; disposition set to Open pending system-level validation and artifact collection.

Remediation:
If crypto.fips_enabled = 0 for Red Hat Linux, configure the operating system to implement DOD-approved encryption.

To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option must be added to the kernel command line during system installation so key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.

Enable FIPS mode with the following command:

# sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

Modify the kernel command line of the current kernel in the "grub.cfg" file by adding the following option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX key in the "/etc/default/grub" file and then rebuilding the "grub.cfg" file:

fips=1

Changes to "/etc/default/grub" require rebuilding the "grub.cfg" file.

On BIOS-based machines, use the following command:

# sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

On UEFI-based machines, use the following command:

# sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

If /boot or /boot/efi reside on separate partitions, the kernel parameter "boot=<partition of /boot or /boot/efi>" must be added to the kernel command line. Identify a partition by running the df /boot or df /boot/efi command:

# sudo df /boot

Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1 495844 53780 416464 12% /boot

To ensure the "boot=" configuration option will work even if device naming changes occur between boots, identify the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the partition with the following command:

# sudo blkid /dev/sda1
/dev/sda1: UUID="05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797" TYPE="ext4"

For the example above, append the following string to the kernel command line:

boot=UUID=05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797

Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

### Change a role to nologin and disconnect the user

ALTER ROLE '<username>' NOLOGIN;
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE usename='<usename>';

### Disconnecting users during a specific time range
Refer to supplementary content APPENDIX-A for a bash script for this example.

The script found in APPENDIX-A using the -l command can disable all users with rolcanlogin=t from logging in. The script keeps track of who it disables in a .restore_login file. After the specified time is over, the same script can be run with the -r command to restore all login connections.

This script would be added to a cron job:

# lock at 5 am every day of the week, month, year at the 0 minute mark.
0 5 * * * postgres /var/lib/pgsql/no_login.sh -d postgres -l
# restore at 5 pm every day of the week, month, year at the 0 minute mark.

### 108. CD16-00-012200 | SV-261965r1137661

- Rule ID: SV-261965r1137661
- Severity: medium
- Rule Title: PostgreSQL must implement NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules to generate and validate cryptographic hashes.

Status: Open

Evidence:
- Static repository review completed on 2026-04-28.
- Control-specific implementation evidence was not demonstrably satisfied from repository artifacts alone; disposition set to Open pending system-level validation and artifact collection.

Remediation:
Configure OpenSSL to be FIPS compliant.

PostgreSQL uses OpenSSL for cryptographic modules. To configure OpenSSL to be FIPS 140-2 compliant, refer to the official RHEL Documentation: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening#switching-the-system-to-fips-mode_using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies.

- Rule ID: SV-261966r1137664
- Severity: medium
- Rule Title: PostgreSQL must implement NIST FIPS 140-2 or 140-3 validated cryptographic modules to protect unclassified information requiring confidentiality and cryptographic protection, in accordance with the data owners' requirements.

Status: Open

Evidence:
- Static repository review completed on 2026-04-28.
- Control-specific implementation evidence was not demonstrably satisfied from repository artifacts alone; disposition set to Open pending system-level validation and artifact collection.

### 110. CD16-00-012400 | SV-261967r1000906

- Rule ID: SV-261967r1000906
- Severity: medium
- Rule Title: PostgreSQL must offload audit data to a separate log management facility; this must be continuous and in near real time for systems with a network connection to the storage facility and weekly or more often for standalone systems.

Status: Open

Evidence:
- Static repository review completed on 2026-04-28.
- Control-specific implementation evidence was not demonstrably satisfied from repository artifacts alone; disposition set to Open pending system-level validation and artifact collection.

Remediation:
Note: The following instructions use the PGDATA and PGVER environment variables. Refer to APPENDIX-F for instructions on configuring PGDATA and APPENDIX-H for PGVER.

Configure PostgreSQL or deploy and configure software tools to transfer audit records to a centralized log management system, continuously and in near real time where a continuous network connection to the log management system exists, or at least weekly in the absence of such a connection.

To ensure logging is enabled, review supplementary content APPENDIX-C for instructions on enabling logging.

With logging enabled, as the database administrator (shown here as "postgres"), configure the following parameters in postgresql.conf (the example uses the default values - tailor for environment):

Note: Consult the organization on how syslog facilities are defined in the syslog daemon configuration.

$ sudo su - postgres
$ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf
log_destination = 'syslog'
syslog_facility = 'LOCAL0'
syslog_ident = 'postgres'

As the system administrator, reload the server with the new configuration:

$ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-${PGVER?}

- Rule ID: SV-283674r1193281
- Severity: high
- Rule Title: PostgreSQL products must be a version supported by the vendor.

Status: Open

Evidence:
- Static repository review completed on 2026-04-28.
- Control-specific implementation evidence was not demonstrably satisfied from repository artifacts alone; disposition set to Open pending system-level validation and artifact collection.

Remediation:
Upgrade or install a version of the product supported by the vendor.
